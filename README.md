# FDM Data Mining Project

This is the project which was given as an Assignment from SLIIT for the subject Fundamentals of Data Mining.

We had 5 members for the assignment.

Basically we implemented Classification, Regression and Clustering.

Classification is used for prdict the "Genre" of the video games.

One Regression model is used for predict the "Gloabal_Sales" and 
that prected value is a input for the next Regression model. 

This model is used to predict the "User_Score".

Clustering model is used for cluster the "User_Score", "Critic_Score" and "Global_Sales".
It contains 4 clusters.

Front-end is developed by Flask and Heroku is used for run the system.
